# Robot-Challenge

Building an eebot mobile robot with a navigation system that can find it’s
way through a maze, reverse, and back it’s way out again

Devising firmware for an embedded system robot (eebot) using assembly language on the HCS12 microcontroller, 
integrating low-level programming for motor control and sensor feedback. 
Will require understanding of hardware-software integration, embedded controllers, 
and real-time navigation systems for robotics applications

------
So far, the project where I learned to display characters on the LCD of the EEBOT is uploaded. This code displays the battery voltage 
and state of switches; these values can be changed by the bumpers and the knob on the eebot, which I found to be fascinating

Will be completed by December 2024
